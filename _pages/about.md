I am a 2nd year PhD candidate, at the [School of Informatics - University of Edinburgh](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ipab), sponsored by the [Edinburgh Centre for Robotics](https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/). I am supervised by [Prof. Chris Xiaoxuan Lu](https://christopherlu.github.io/) (UCL) and [Prof. Oisin Mac Aodha](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/omacaod/) (UoE). My research interests revolve around spatial representations aimed at addressing challenges in robotics. 

In November 2021, I completed with distinction the Artificial Intelligence master's programme at the University of Edinburgh, where I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Chris Williams](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ckiw/) on the topic of inference and learning for [generative capsule models](https://github.com/tsagkas/capsules). In August 2019, I was awarded the Diploma of Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Patras, in Greece (graduated 4th in my class out of 202 students – GPA: 8.11 out of 10). I completed my ECE Diploma thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Athanassios Skodras](http://www.ece.upatras.gr/skodras/), researching [real-time hand-gesture recognition](/projects/2_project/) via sEMG signals.

<!-- objective is to ground language into neural implicit spatial representations, for the purpose of enabling open vocabulary queries in mobile robotics.  

In November 2021, I completed with distinction the Artificial Intelligence master's programme at the University of Edinburgh, where I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Chris Williams](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ckiw/) on a novel inference and learning algorithm for [generative capsule models](https://github.com/tsagkas/capsules). In August 2019, I was awarded the Diploma of Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Patras, in Greece (graduated 4th in my class out of 202 students – GPA: 8.11 out of 10). I completed my ECE Diploma thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Athanassios Skodras](http://www.ece.upatras.gr/skodras/), researching the use of CNNs for [real-time hand-gesture recognition](/projects/2_project/) via sEMG signals. -->
